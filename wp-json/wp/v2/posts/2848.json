Modular construction through prefabrication has long been considered a solution to the lagging productivity gains for this industry. A critical review of the competitive forces acting on the construction industry reveals three key factors restricting the sustainable growth of modular construction \u2013 the market cyclicality, the demand for customization, and the market fragmentation. Learning from Operation Breakthrough in the 1970s and the recent failure of Katerra, the new generation of firms Blackhorn backs in prefabricated or modular construction take one of two differentiated approaches. The first approach leverages new technology, such as machine intelligence, computer vision, and robotics, to automate part of the work of a single trade using a capital-light and agile business model. The second combines physical and digital technologies, acting as a supply chain orchestrator, to outsource production while using software to generate fully engineered, costed and code-compliant housing schemes in real-time.<\/p><h2>Is Prefabrication Solving the Construction Productivity Problem?<\/h2><p>The construction industry makes up approximately 13% of global GDP, accounting for $11 trillion of annual value-added. Yet its meager 1% productivity growth over the last two decades is less than one-third the productivity growth seen in the manufacturing industry.1 The construction sector is also characterized by cost overruns and delays, with 98% of megaprojects experiencing cost overruns at an average 80% cost increase and 20-month slippage. This has translated to an overall operating margin of just 5% or less for many general contractors, despite the high level of risk they assume.1\u00a0 Finally, construction is one of the highest emitting and most dangerous sectors, accounting for 39% of carbon emissions and more fatal work injuries than any other industry.<\/p><p><strong>Prefabrication \u2013 the practice of manufacturing and assembling certain components offsite \u2013 offers a compelling opportunity to make at-scale construction more efficient, profitable, sustainable, and safe for workers.<\/strong> Prefabrication, often in the form of modular construction, is expected to speed up project timelines by 20% to 50% and to realize more than 20% in cost savings.1 With new real-estate construction expected to reach $130 billion in Europe and the US by 2030, this would translate to $22 billion of annual cost savings.1 It is also expected to lower energy use and waste, increase quality control, and decrease at least 50% of construction-related fatalities. Given its potential to disrupt construction, prefabrication has expanded from its common application in affordable housing to private and commercial real estate where customization and quality take priority, as well as to public infrastructure, which demands higher productivity in larger quantities.<\/p><p>Despite prefabrication\u2019s potential, past US attempts have failed spectacularly. The US Housing and Urban Development\u2019s (HUD) Operation Breakthrough and the recent bankruptcy of SoftBank-backed Katerra serve as two key examples. In 1969, HUD launched Operation Breakthrough in an attempt to reduce housing costs and stimulate more housing production for all income levels. Operation Breakthrough sought to act as a market aggregator and promote economies of scale by applying mass production techniques to home-building. Similarly, Katerra\u2019s co-founder and CEO Michael Marks aimed to streamline the construction industry in the same way he had streamlined the electronics supply chain as CEO of Flextronics. In 2015, he launched Katerra as a one-stop-shop that sought to manage the supply chain by shipping materials directly from factories via one vendor, thereby eliminating the middlemen.<\/p><h4>Past prefabrication models have failed largely due to their capital-intensive and vertically integrated approach that did not account for: the market cyclicality, demand for customization, and the industry\u2019s fragmented nature.<\/h4><ol><li aria-level=\"1\"><em><strong>Cyclicality<\/strong><\/em> - The market demand for new construction is highly responsive to changes in macroeconomic conditions and the resulting changes in interest rates and the availability of debt. The residential construction subsector is inherently \u201ccounter-cyclical\u201d because demand falls when interest rates rise during an economic boom. When one assumes a lot of debt or makes big capital investments, the industry\u2019s cyclical nature is highly problematic. Modular firms that participated in Operation Breakthrough, for example, invested heavily to build plants that required large amounts of equity and debt. When demand unexpectedly fell and interest rates simultaneously rose due to \u201cstagflation\u201d in the late 1970s, the plants couldn\u2019t operate at full capacity, but overhead and debt remained high, resulting in stranded assets they could no longer afford. More recently Katerra invested heavily to build new plants and acquire multiple companies to achieve more vertical integration. The COVID-19 pandemic drastically exacerbated the company\u2019s project delays and cost overruns, and successfully integrating the cultures and work processes of the multiple companies they acquired so they could interoperate seamlessly together proved challenging. Several prefabrication models in other parts of the world have proven successful because they did not have to account for such cyclicality. Especially in the homebuilding subsector, the demand for homes in many European markets is driven by long-term government investment in affordable \u201csocial\u201d housing, resulting in relative stability and predictability of demand. This relative stability makes it easier for firms to make investments in new technology innovations, creating a virtuous cycle.\u00a0 In contrast, the US market is largely driven by consumer demand.<\/li><li aria-level=\"1\"><em><strong>Customization<\/strong><\/em> - Modular construction is challenged by a high level of customization to accommodate for the significant differences in building design caused by local code requirements, geological and climate conditions, user requirements, and socioeconomic factors such as material and labor supply in highly localized markets. Conventional modular construction fabricators have found it difficult to scale production while supporting customization. Operation Breakthrough failed to recognize the highly localized demand for customization in the housing market, beginning its mass production efforts before realizing there were conflicting building codes across states. It was also surprised when consumers didn\u2019t want identical housing, viewing it as inferior and lower quality. Katerra similarly overlooked the differences between local codes and regulations. While Michael Marks was able to standardize consumer electronics production at Flextronics, he was unable to use the same approach at Katerra because each building product was inherently unique. As a result, Katerra could not accurately predict material and component needs, preventing it from reaching the economies of scale needed to be profitable.<\/li><li aria-level=\"1\"><em><strong>Fragmentation<\/strong><\/em> - Construction is a highly fragmented industry made up of many small firms, with the average US construction company employing about 4 people. Half of the industry is made up of small, specialized firms that focus on one or two trades or \u201cswimlanes'' (i.e. plumbing, electrical, lumber). Project delivery is also dependent on many stakeholders, such as architects, engineers, and manufacturers, who lack the experience of their counterparts and may have conflicting goals. Given the industry\u2019s fragmentation, systemic innovations across multiple swimlanes diffuse more slowly, at a 17% adoption rate, compared to the 40% adoption rate of innovations within a single swimlane. Both Operation Breakthrough and Katerra failed to recognize the stickiness of traditional processes and business models across value chain partners. When Katerra first launched as a one-stop shop for materials, it struggled to convince architects and designers to adopt their systemic approach to construction. Rather than adjust its approach, Katerra doubled down by acquiring architecture, design, and manufacturing firms in a failed attempt to control the entire supply chain.<\/li><\/ol><p>\u00a0<\/p><h2>Investing in the Next Generation of Prefabrication with Blackhorn<\/h2><p>To address these pressing challenges, Blackhorn pursues a differentiated strategy by investing in firms that adopt one of two more capital-efficient business models: 1) a fractional prefabrication approach; or 2) a supply chain orchestrator approach.<\/p><h3>Fractional Prefabricator Business Model<\/h3><p>Companies pursuing the fractional prefabricator approach target a select segment of production within a single trade\u2019s swimlane that faces a shortage of skilled labor and that they can automate very cost-effectively relative to onsite construction while using a capital-light business model. This typically translates into a hardware-integrated data ingestion and machine intelligence solution that enables mass customization of an element within a single swimlane. This approach allows companies to integrate seamlessly into the existing supply chain and deliver long-term sustainable profitability, while being resilient to demand downturns. Three Blackhorn portfolio companies \u2013 Agorus, Hyperframe, and Toggle \u2013 demonstrate Blackhorn\u2019s fractional prefabrication approach well.<\/p><h2>Company: Agorus<\/h2><p><strong>Problem:<\/strong> Homebuilding remains archaic, with 96% of data uncaptured, expensive labor costs, and stagnant productivity growth given its many inefficiencies.<\/p><p><strong>Approach:<\/strong> Agorus is building a vertically integrated automation system where developers can design, manufacture, and assemble a home using one software platform. Their software solution transforms 2D or 3D architectural designs into machine and human instructions for manufacturing custom wall, floor and roofing panels. This allows Agorus to segment the digital build into 2D panels which are then constructed on an automated just-in-time manufacturing line. By owning the engineering and using premium-grade specialized lumber, Agorus is able to standardize the components and engineering process while allowing for completely custom sizes and designs. These 2D panels are then transported to the jobsite and assembled by field partners in a few days rather than the several weeks typical of the traditional approach.<\/p><p><strong>Impact:<\/strong> Agorus\u2019 system can offer customers a high degree of customization while facilitating seamless collaboration across developers, designers, engineers, and module fabricators. The integration between its software and automated production line reduces the cost of customization and enables just-in-time manufacturing for high asset utilization. Through strategic partnerships with established panel fabricators and onsite assembly teams, Agorus is able to operate under a capital-light, high-margin, and low waste model. By capturing most of the value of design customization and shorter construction cycles, Agorus expects 40%+ margins and <3% final wastage compared with traditional framing, which aims for a 10% margin with\u00a0 20% wastage.<\/p><h2>Company: Hyperframe<\/h2><p><strong>Problem:<\/strong> Interior wall framing, which has not evolved for decades, is custom-cut and placed and screwed by hand, resulting in a high reliance on skilled workers for reading drawings and for quality control. Metal framing also has a high potential for traumatic and repetitive stress workplace injuries, exacerbating the current labor shortage in wall framing.<\/p><p><strong>Approach:<\/strong> Hyperframe has developed a sophisticated but highly adaptable steel framing system to offer customized solutions for a wide variety of customer needs. Hyperframe combines digital design model integration software, mixed reality software, and semi-autonomous manufacturing to make wall framing simpler and safer for workers. Workers without extensive wall framing expertise can use a hardhat-mounted visor that provides a heads-up augmented reality display with Hyperframe\u2019s QR-coded metal studs to guide them where to connect the framing materials with easy snap-in connectors.<\/p><p><strong>Impact:<\/strong> Its integration of augmented reality wearables with its custom material packaging system enables hassle-free, 10-15X faster on-site assembly without the need for wall framing specialists. Its software platform also automates material orders for semi-autonomous manufacturing with partners licensing its technology and acting as distributors, reducing run-time and production costs. Hyperframe\u2019s system allows workers to assemble high-quality framing more quickly, with much less waste and with far fewer workplace injuries than traditional wall framing. Its two pilot projects, for example, generated zero waste. These efficiencies translate to an improved profit margin throughout the value chain. Hyperframe\u2019s licensing operating model further elevates its profit margin compared with conventional framing suppliers, while still offering 15% savings and faster interior framing and finishing for customers. The system\u2019s adaptability and its value-based pricing have the potential to increase the addressable framing market threefold to over $3B in US metropolitan areas.<\/p><h2>Company: Toggle<\/h2><p><strong>Problem:<\/strong> Reinforced concrete traditionally uses rebar cages assembled manually on site in an inefficient, expensive, and dangerous manner by highly skilled workers, who are currently in short supply.<\/p><p><strong>Approach:<\/strong> Toggle partially automates the assembly of rebar cages using its patented robot-enabled solution done in a controlled factory environment. Toggle\u2019s software-driven approach offers real-time order progress tracking and optimizes customer design with modular detailing. Its emphasis on human-robot collaboration enables increased production efficiency and improved flexibility to satisfy various design needs. Toggle\u2019s use of proprietary robotic and mechatronic systems combined with industrial automation hardware from manufacturing leaders like ABB results in a purpose-built, efficient, and scalable platform.<\/p><p><strong>Impact:<\/strong> Toggle aims to become a labor multiplier by using robots for highly repetitive, error-prone and fatigue-inducing tasks so that experienced rebar workers can focus on the more value-additive assembly, increasing value for customers, workers and suppliers. Toggle\u2019s off-site pre-assembly provides a 4X increase in productivity and can accelerate job site rebar installation timelines by as much as 90%. By relocating skilled rebar workers from on-site, often at height with access constraints, to Toggle\u2019s off-site, safe working environments, Toggle drastically reduces the risk of injury or fatality on construction sites. Toggle supplies preassembled customized rebar cages for both on-site reinforced concrete placement as well as off-site pre-cast concrete production. Toggle\u2019s production facilities are strategically located next to transportation hubs for major markets to minimize logistic costs and further improve its profitability.<\/p><h3>Supply Chain Orchestrator Business Model<\/h3><p>Companies pursuing the supply chain orchestrator approach design the system and the modular components, but outsource the production of each element, such as pre-assembly, manufacturing, and final installation. This allows such companies to take a lifecycle perspective to cost management without assuming all the debt necessary to own each element of the supply chain. This is in direct contrast to Katerra\u2019s model, which sought to control the supply chain by acquiring and owning every segment, making it highly vulnerable to the market\u2019s cyclicality. Blackhorn\u2019s portfolio company, Modulous, serves as a good example.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><h2>Company: Modulous<\/h2><p><strong>Problem:<\/strong> There is immense pressure to increase affordable housing stock, but past vertically-integrated modular solutions have been too capital-intensive and debt-leveraged to be resilient to high levels of demand fluctuation.<\/p><p><strong>Approach:<\/strong> Modulous has created a digital platform to synchronize the design, approval, procurement, and logistics of multi-family homes, shortening the delivery lead time by general contractors of building modules to typically one week from order. Project designs are based on Modulous\u2019 standardized Kit of Parts, which is a series of sub-assemblies from its distributed supply chain that offer a broad range of options for customers. Since the Kit of Parts is manufactured by third parties, Modulus doesn\u2019t use fixed factories, allowing for just-in-time delivery and assembly by local contractors. In the long run, Modulous aims to serve as a digital marketplace among module manufacturers, building component suppliers, architects, engineers and developers, allowing information flows and transactions across the network.<\/p><p><strong>Impact:<\/strong> By adopting the Kit of Parts concept, Modulous is able to significantly shorten the design cycle, and enable fast delivery and easy installation through its distributed supply chain. The technology-centric, outsourced manufacturing and assembly approach allows Modulous to operate at over 25% gross margins at maturity. The company not only helps customers capture the high housing demand ordered by the UK central and local government agencies but also offers a highly versatile platform to meet the requirements for various types of construction projects, providing cost and schedule assurance for customers to stay competitive in this fragmented market.<\/p><h2>What Our Companies Share in Common:<\/h2><p>Whether through the fractional prefabrication business model or supply chain orchestrator model, our portfolio companies set out their growth trajectory based on a deep understanding of the fragmented construction market and the lessons learned from Operation Breakthrough and the failed last generation prefabricators such as Katerra. Our portfolio company founders focus on specific pain points instead of trying to \u2018solve them all\u2019. This allows them to develop capital-light, agile business models, and to generate higher profit margins through strategic partnerships with material suppliers, manufacturers, technology enablers, architects and developers. This approach is also expected to improve the construction sector\u2019s worker safety and job quality amidst an unprecedented labor crunch, and its environmental impact by reducing waste and energy use. Most traditional VC investors have shied away from investing in manufacturing\/service enterprises that prefabricate buildings.\u00a0 Blackhorn Ventures is stepping into this underinvested niche in the construction sector aggressively to invest in these kinds of capital-light, high-margin startups, and has seen strong initial results to date.<\/p>","_et_gb_content_width":"","content-type":"","inline_featured_image":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[14,32,13],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-2848","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-blackhorn-news","category-built-environment","category-portfolio-company-news"],"yoast_head":"<!--
