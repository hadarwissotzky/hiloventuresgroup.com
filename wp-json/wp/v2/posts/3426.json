By leveraging partnerships with local bike shops for test rides and repairs, and their deep expertise from stints at Lime, Bird, and Scoot, the team at Ridepanda is poised to be a leader in the industry and to make a significant impact on the way we think about enterprise transportation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-weight: normal;\"><em>\u201cRegardless of what value pool you\u2019re in, regardless of what mode you\u2019re in, this is a great story, in our mind, because micromobility is going to grow across the globe. It\u2019s going to grow across form factors, across sharing and ownership,\u201d -Kersten Heineke, a partner at McKinsey and Company and co-leader of the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility.<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Navigating Urban Mobility Woes<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-weight: normal;\">As <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.worldbank.org\/en\/topic\/urbandevelopment\/overview\">cities become denser and urban populations grow<\/a>,<\/u> the way people move within cities is rapidly changing.

Recent events, including the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/04\/02\/paris-votes-overwhelmingly-to-ban-shared-e-scooters\/\">Paris e-scooter ban<\/a>, have put increasing pressure on shared fleets.\u00a0 Meanwhile, as municipalities have launched e-bike rebate programs and the growth of individual ownership models have contributed to\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/future-electric-e-bike-market-size-rise-alex-jackson\/\">e-bikes growing faster than ever<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">When Ridepanda first launched their original online marketplace, they realized that companies offering mobility leases and subscriptions lacked diversity in vehicle form factors, experienced supply chain constraints, and had limited access to repairs due to proprietary components and lack of local support. Where unit economics are challenging and profitability has proved elusive for companies like Bird, Vanmoof, Helbiz and others, Ridepanda benefits from an asset-light revenue model that is generating significantly more revenue per vehicle over the course of the vehicle&#8217;s lifetime.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Ridepanda\u2019s new subscription and leasing platform (available at <a href=\"http:\/\/get.ridepanda.com\/\">ridepanda.com<\/a>) features an extensive range of vehicles including cargo e-bikes, mountain e-bikes, road bikes, commuter e-bikes, folding bikes, and high-performance scooters from well-established brands like Giant, Diamondback and Dahon, as well as newer brands like Segway, and Okai. With Ridepanda, employees log in to a customized portal, select their vehicle from a wide variety of form factors, price points, and size\/color\/frame variations from a diverse set of high quality vendors using standard components.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_image src=&#8221;https:\/\/blackhornvc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/RP3.png&#8221; title_text=&#8221;RP3&#8243; align=&#8221;center&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.4&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][\/et_pb_image][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.4&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The shift to a leasing model with owned and operated local hubs (called \u2018PandaHubs\u2019) has allowed Ridepanda to have a closer, longer-term relationship with their customer by\u00a0 allowing them to test ride and choose the right vehicle, and receive ongoing servicing as needed throughout the duration of their lease.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This new round of financing will be leveraged to grow Ridepanda\u2019s team across engineering, sales and marketing, and help accomplish their mission of having 100,000 employees commuting to and from work, living an active lifestyle, on a Ridepanda vehicle by 2026.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jane Smith, Transportation Demand Manager at Amazon emphasized the value to the company\u2019s 100K+ commuters, saying &#8220;Ridepanda&#8217;s platform has provided a unique and valuable solution for our employees, offering them a wide array of options and making their commutes more enjoyable and sustainable while reducing our environmental impact.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Traction to Date: How Ridepanda is changing the commute<\/h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many large companies find themselves in a tricky balancing act: trying to retain talent, achieve decarbonization commitments, and bring employees back to the office in-person. Ridepanda has begun working with some of the largest tech companies in the world to help them tackle all three of these issues. Google, Amazon, and others are seeing their employees jump at the opportunity to have a healthier, environmentally and pocket-friendly way to come back into the office. This offers a seamless introduction to micromobility for the employee, and a compelling employee benefit that improves overall wellness, decreases scope 3 emissions, and increases employee satisfaction.<\/p>\n<h2>The right team at the right time<\/h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Ridepanda team is led by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/chinmaymalaviya\/details\/experience\/\">Chinmay Malaviya<\/a> (CEO) and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/cdepman\/\">Charlie Depman<\/a> (CTO). Chinmay sold his last company to Delivery Hero and led strategy at Lime. Charlie has spent his career building partnerships and back-end infrastructure in some of the largest players in the micromobility space including Scoot Networks, which was acquired by Bird. The two have extensive experience scaling startups from zero to scale, and just brought on a new Head of Marketing, Stephen Rodriguez, who was previously at Scoot\/Bird. They have surrounded themselves with an outstanding set of experts in micromobility, GTM sales, and engineering.
