For the past two decades, demand for electricity across the United States was flat. However, this is dramatically changing. The combination of accelerating growth in electricity use by data centers mining cryptocurrency and delivering AI, plus longer-term electrification of manufacturing, electric vehicles and building heating has upended that status quo. All told, grid planners across the U.S. forecast an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.canarymedia.com\/articles\/transmission\/suddenly-us-electricity-demand-is-spiking-can-the-grid-keep-up\">increase of 38 gigawatts of peak demand by 2028<\/a>, according to data reported to federal regulators.\u00a0 As the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/business\/2024\/03\/07\/ai-data-centers-power\/\">Washington Post recently reported<\/a>, \u201cVast swaths of the United States are at risk of running short of power as electricity-hungry data centers and clean-technology factories proliferate around the country, leaving utilities and regulators grasping for credible plans to expand the nation\u2019s creaking power grid.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_image src=&#8221;https:\/\/blackhornvc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/BuzzInv1.png&#8221; title_text=&#8221;BuzzInv1&#8243; align=&#8221;center&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.4&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; theme_builder_area=&#8221;post_content&#8221; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;][\/et_pb_image][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.4&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; theme_builder_area=&#8221;post_content&#8221; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<\/p>\n<p>As both the transmission network and the electrical distribution network are increasingly strained, utilities are looking to build \u2018digital twins\u2019 to streamline asset maintenance and repair. Utilities face three large and growing problems that require immediate behavior change: 1) the growing cost of extreme storms, wildfires, unexpected blackouts and preventable failures, 2) the need to rapidly modernize the grid given a jump in renewable energy generation and distributed energy resources (including EVs and energy storage), and 3) an aging workforce and severe labor shortages as more than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.powermag.com\/the-next-step-for-utilities-in-workforce-transformation\/\">50% of the utility\u2019s workforce<\/a> is set to retire over the next decade.<\/p>\n<p>At the center of these three challenges sits Buzz Solutions. Their AI-powered visual data insights and predictive analytics platform is designed to provide fault detection, monitoring, and management for utility power infrastructure and renewable energy assets. Buzz Solutions\u2019s 100,000+ image-to-image source of record acts as a <a href=\"https:\/\/blackhornvc.com\/blog\/controlling-the-foundational-data-asset-ais-impact-on-industry-4-0-and-industrial-decarbonization\/\">foundational data asset<\/a> that is core to training their best-in-class AI model. The company is quickly becoming the go-to solution for visualizing data sets to enable resilience &#8211; and real savings for utilities.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The world of grid inspections is plagued with inefficiencies<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to speed, accuracy and expense, grid inspections are far behind the standards of other critical infrastructure. Electrical utilities suffer losses of $170B annually due to network failures, forced shutdowns, and natural disasters. On average, grid inspection takes six to eight weeks for an engineer to conduct manually. This work comes at a great cost to utility workers: power line repairmen rank in the top 20 most dangerous jobs in the US and account for 24.2 deaths per 100,000 workers according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/iif\/#:~:text=There%20were%205%2C190%20fatal%20work,increase%20from%204%2C764%20in%202020.\">US Bureau of Labor Statistics<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Compounding this historic challenge for the energy industry, utilities have faced a record number of thefts (e.g., copper and other raw materials), break-ins and vandalism at substations (including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2023\/01\/18\/1149694402\/another-north-carolina-power-substation-shot\">several high-profile incidents <\/a>resulting in blackouts). These events have spurred calls for new regulatory mandates for greater monitoring and autonomous operations, given that many substations are in highly remote areas. The utility industry is urgently looking for new solutions to help avoid these costly and high-risk incidents and their associated negative publicity and potential for lawsuits.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_image src=&#8221;https:\/\/blackhornvc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/BuzzInv2.jpg&#8221; title_text=&#8221;BuzzInv2&#8243; align=&#8221;center&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.4&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; theme_builder_area=&#8221;post_content&#8221; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;][\/et_pb_image][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.4&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; theme_builder_area=&#8221;post_content&#8221; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Buzz Solutions offers an AI platform to efficiently inspect, monitor and manage power infrastructure<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Buzz Solutions provides a multi-product visual data digitization and analytics platform to address utilities\u2019 inspection and monitoring analytics needs via two solutions: PowerAI and PowerGUARD.\u00a0 Unlike other solutions on the market, Buzz does not need to bear the expense of collecting raw data.\u00a0 Instead, they partner with drone, helicopter, and ground-based providers and existing utility sub-contractors.<\/p>\n<p>PowerAI is a cloud-based AI software analyzing visual transmission and distribution data.\u00a0 It does this faster, cheaper, more accurately, and safer than current manual processes. With its human-in-the-loop algorithm, PowerAI generates materially higher accuracy, at 60% of the cost, and 5X faster than manual processes, saving Buzz\u2019s customers~$5M daily in reduced outage risk (assuming analysis of roughly 2M images per year). PowerAI ingests aerial visual data collected via third-party drone partners or a utilities in-house drone inspection team. It processes these images through their data management and AI fueled smart algorithms. It stores the analytics and reporting on a utility\u2019s IT\/OT systems to address cybersecurity considerations; and then integrates the insights into the utility\u2019s GIS or work order systems via APIs to ensure the necessary actions tie into workflow and maintenance prioritization systems. In 2024, Buzz plans to expand PowerAI functionality to include smart analytics of solar and hydro assets. For PowerAI, Buzz\u2019s extensive field inspection data volume source acts as a foundational data asset that is core to their competitive advantage.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_image src=&#8221;https:\/\/blackhornvc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/BuzzInv3.png&#8221; title_text=&#8221;BuzzInv3&#8243; align=&#8221;center&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.4&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; theme_builder_area=&#8221;post_content&#8221; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;][\/et_pb_image][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.4&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; theme_builder_area=&#8221;post_content&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<\/p>\n<p>In 2023, Buzz launched its second platform solution, PowerGUARD, as an edge AI monitoring platform providing 24\/7 visual monitoring for utility substations. PowerGUARD analyzes visual data and thermal imagery via fixed on-site cameras; and provides intrusion, worker safety, and equipment condition monitoring as well as fire, smoke and arcing detection with their AI-powered alerting algorithm. It then delivers these alerts to the relevant utility teams, such as the substation operators or security teams. In 2024, Buzz plans to expand PowerGUARD\u2019s product coverage to include monitoring and analytics of wind infrastructure assets.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s there but we can make it more explicit about how it has influenced our conviction. The primary piece is adding on the Substation product and evolving to a full platform solution that captures, digitizes, analyzes and builds actions into the utility workflow system for all visual data assets.

The market is expected to double over the next decade as voluntary and mandated inspections increase. New transmission builds, for example, now require an initial and post-construction inspection. As inspections transition from manual processes to more autonomous drone and robotic data collection, it is expected that utilities will capture 10x more images for each monitored structure. With more data comes the need for better prioritization and actionable insights &#8211; exactly where Buzz is positioned to win.\u00a0 Additionally, the growth of renewable energy assets creates a large and growing market opportunity for solar, wind, and hydro inspection analysis, which PowerAI could service with minimal product updates.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_image _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.4&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; theme_builder_area=&#8221;post_content&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; title_text=&#8221;BuzzInv5&#8243; src=&#8221;https:\/\/blackhornvc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/BuzzInv5.png&#8221; align=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/et_pb_image][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.4&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; theme_builder_area=&#8221;post_content&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<\/p>\n<p>Given the intermittent and unpredictable load profiles of EVs and DERs, implications for the\u00a0 utility distribution network are still unknown. However, the aging grid is increasingly stressed and strained. The more utilities monitor grid equipment and assets, the better they understand their condition. With this understanding, grid operators will be able to better estimate\u00a0 load patterns, infrastructure capacity, and speed the pace of electrification and decarbonization. We believe the combined offering of PowerAI and PowerGUARD position Buzz to be the 0nly utility tuned platform that will increasingly capture, digitize, provide superior analytics, and seamlessly build actions into the utility workflows\u00a0 across all visual data assets.
