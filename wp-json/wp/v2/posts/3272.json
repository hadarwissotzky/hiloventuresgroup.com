We\u2019re supportive of transparency and radical candor, but in times of crisis, people don\u2019t need another reason to panic<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><u>Customers \u2013 Communicate Stability<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s worse than a company that\u2019s only a few years old without much money in the bank?

If presenting options, have a preferred option<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have contingency plans.Things happen \u2013 especially in times such as these\u2026especially in startups.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Separately, communicate with ALL investors in a written format designed to exude calm thoughtfulness and preparedness.Offer to listen to them if they want to reach out<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In most complex situations, appreciate that you are only one of many companies navigating uncertainty, and that everybody is touched in some way by the historic events we\u2019re living through. As with any complex situation, seek advice from people you trust, and in the end, use your best judgment to make the best decisions you can.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Know that the entire team at Blackhorn is with you for every step of the journey, in good times and bad.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][et_pb_row custom_padding_last_edited=&#8221;on|phone&#8221;
