Some things it addresses with tax credits, and that&#8217;s going to spur investment in those areas. Some things it addresses with formula grants or other kinds of grant programs. The thought is that it will spur investment, by providing federal investments for industries that require a big capital outlay.

These are the sectors that need to be decarbonized. <strong><em>Our thesis is about the fact that we will have an impact by investing in those companies that are going to manage this energy transition.<\/em><\/strong> We are going to invest in companies that say, for example, \u201cThis is a massive transition for utilities. How can we do that and do it smoothly?\u201d We have an opportunity to modernize the grid in a way that has both sides of the meter talking to each other, and helping grid managers ensure that they&#8217;re living up to all their ambitions with respect to their renewable energy goals and their emissions reduction goals. <strong><em>There&#8217;s a great deal of grid modernization that has to go on. We&#8217;re investing in companies that are going to facilitate that. And the same goes with the built environment.<\/em><\/strong> The built environment is 40% of our emissions, and we really are going to get to the kind of emissions reductions that we promised as part of our participation in the Paris Accords. If we&#8217;re going to do that, we have to impact the built environment in a positive way. And so that&#8217;s going to be people thinking about building materials, but it&#8217;s also going to be people who understand that managing the activities in a building site, or managing the meter inside of a building, or rethinking how you plan to increase the efficiency of the building, is all part of a decarbonized economy\u00a0.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Is there a particular sector of technology that you think will see a particularly significant uptick thanks to the IRA?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think we were already at a place where we were going to experience a fairly precipitous change in the electric vehicle market. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coxautoinc.com\/market-insights\/ev-sales-hit-new-record-in-q2-2022\/\">You can see it building<\/a>\u2013 it felt like we were coming to a tipping point.

They should actually ensure that they have a fundamentally sound solution that can be commercialized<\/em><\/strong>. It&#8217;s not hurtful to have these kinds of public dollars available. But I hope that founders don&#8217;t believe that they should try to mold their concept to what the Inflation Reduction Act says, because anytime you have a space like this, you\u2019re using kind of a blunt instrument. I mean,<strong><em> a tax credit is a fairly blunt instrument<\/em><\/strong>. And so if I&#8217;m a founder, and I have a startup, and I&#8217;ve got a new solution, my funding is going to probably start out in a way that&#8217;s relatively typical for venture capital funding, and over time, <a href=\"https:\/\/airtable.com\/shrzbm0uBAWOyP7Sd\">it might be able to take advantage of some byproduct of the Inflation Reduction Act,<\/a> but probably not in the first instance.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Would you be able to give us a bullish and a bearish scenario for how the IRA affects us?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bullish side is, I think that because this act covers the sectors that we care about most, because it&#8217;s about decarbonization, it fits hand in glove with our narrative. <strong><em>And so, if everything were to go perfectly, this could make just a tremendous difference in our ability to address climate change in the short term, and have a tremendous positive impact on our portfolio companies and the companies we will invest in over the next year or two, because our thesis remains about these sectors. <\/em><\/strong>The bearish part of this is that this is all really big. It comes on the heels of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and it requires the federal government to do a great deal that it&#8217;s not to date capable of doing. New offices have to be stood up \u2013 for the infrastructure act alone, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.energy.gov\/articles\/biden-harris-administration-launches-new-offices-lower-energy-costs-and-deploy-clean-power\">Department of Energy had to stand up 30 new offices <\/a>to manage the dollars that are going out the door. And so it&#8217;s not to fault the federal government. It&#8217;s just that the two came together very quickly. I think it would be fair to say that today, as the Act has just passed, we don&#8217;t have either the personnel nor the organizations within federal agencies to get this out the door. Now, we have to build that. the bearish scenario is that we don&#8217;t build it right. It takes longer to get out the door. There&#8217;s a lag time that impacts investors in a negative way because the returns come later down the road, but it also takes up precious time with addressing environmental issues including climate change.<strong><em> So the most bearish thing, the biggest concern I have about this is whether the federal government is fully equipped to do what&#8217;s necessary to make this money as impactful as it needs to be both from an economic perspective in reducing inflation and growing the economy, growing American jobs, but also in a climate\/ environmental perspective, and addressing carbon in a timely fashion<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_image src=&#8221;https:\/\/blackhornvc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/GInvest1.png&#8221; title_text=&#8221;GInvest1&#8243; align=&#8221;center&#8221; admin_label=&#8221;Image&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.17.3&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][\/et_pb_image][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.17.3&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;]<\/p>\n<pre><em>(Credit: Rocky Mountain Institute)<\/em><\/pre>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.17.3&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>With the recent passage of the CHIPS Act, it seems like America has embraced some bipartisan action regarding industrial policy.

I think we still manufacture a lot of things in America, our manufacturing economy has played such a significant role in our economic well being. But we&#8217;ve also not done as well where things like chips are concerned, in maintaining our lead in high tech manufacturing. Other countries have done well in that \u2013 it&#8217;s not like we&#8217;ve forfeited our position completely, but I think <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/marcochiappetta\/2022\/08\/18\/innovation-and-the-implications-of-the-chips-and-science-act-with-synopsys-ceo\/?sh=6581b2e515bb\"><strong><em>the CHIPS Act is going to allow us to reestablish our leadership position<\/em><\/strong><\/a>. That&#8217;s important for a couple of reasons. Obviously, it helps grow the economy, we&#8217;re becoming more and more of a software driven economy. But in addition to that, <strong><em>it would appear that the legislation is going to incentivize jobs to stay on shore<\/em><\/strong>. And finally, it hopefully resolves a problem where the supply chain is concerned, because I think there were a lot of different issues around supply chains and chips, and this hopefully will impact our ability to have chips available, and not have to rely on other foreign countries to provide them for us.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_image src=&#8221;https:\/\/blackhornvc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Solar1.jpg&#8221; title_text=&#8221;Solar1&#8243; align=&#8221;center&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.17.3&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][\/et_pb_image][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.17.3&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;]<\/p>\n<pre><em>(Image courtesy of Blackhorn Ventures)<\/em><\/pre>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.17.3&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>You&#8217;ve been around the block as far as climate legislation is concerned. What is it specifically that makes this time truly historic?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;d say the first thing is the amount of investment that is involved. When I was Governor of Colorado, we went through the Great Recession, and we had the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. And the total amount of investment in clean energy was $90 billion. And President Obama was very much a person who believed that we needed to address climate change and clean energy. This time, first of all, it&#8217;s 14 years later. <a href=\"https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/drought-isnt-just-western-u-102146939.html\"><strong><em>The issues that impact us related to climate and the environment are significantly more pronounced than they were 14 years ago<\/em><\/strong><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/drought-isnt-just-western-u-102146939.html\">.<\/a> People who are looking at the clock and thinking about the window we have to address this have shortened the timeframe within which we have to act. So there&#8217;s far more money, but that money is tied to the urgency that we have to act. It&#8217;s also concentrated in places where we&#8217;re pretty confident <a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocol.com\/climate\/tech-workers-quitting-climate-jobs\">it&#8217;s going to cause people to invest at a deeper level <\/a>on the private side and help us to make that transition from a carbonized economy to a decarbonized one.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019d like to add that <strong><em>this bill really does more from an environmental justice perspective than any piece of legislation that I can ever remember<\/em><\/strong>. The kinds of ways it incentivizes to build out energy efficiency and low income neighborhoods, the things that does to ensure that power delivered to low income neighborhoods is clean power, is remarkable. There are a variety of incentives for transportation to be carbon free, and that transportation be available to low income people and people who live in marginalized communities. This legislation does more than any other thing I&#8217;ve ever seen in that regard.
